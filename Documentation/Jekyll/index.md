# De.SWebhosting.Bootstrap

## Introduction

### What does it do?

This package provides some view helpers and utility functions for TYPO3 Flow that can make Frontend development easier.

The default ouput of the view helpers is optimized to work with the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) framework
(therefore the name) but can be useful with other frameworks or custom styles as well.

Please see the [README.md](https://github.com/astehlik/Flow-Package-De.SWebhosting.Bootstrap) of this package for
an overview of the functionality.

This manual describes the available features in-depth.
